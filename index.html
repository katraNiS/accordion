        <p>Click on the buttons to open the collapsible content.</p>
        <button class="accordion">Vinyls</button>
        <div class="panel vinyls">
            <p>Vinyls (more accurately called vinyl records) are analog sound storage media: flat discs made from polyvinyl chloride
            (PVC), featuring a spiral groove that physically encodes sound, played on a turntable with a stylus that reads the
            groove to produce audio.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">CDs</button>
        <div class="panel cds">
            <p>Compact discs (CDs) are optical discs, typically 120mm in diameter, that store digital data like music, software, and
            images, using a laser to read microscopic "pits" and "lands" on their surface, revolutionizing audio playback by
            replacing analog formats like vinyl and cassettes with clear, digital sound</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Merch</button>
        <div class="panel merch">
            <p>Compact band merch refers to smaller, portable, and often affordable items that fans can easily buy and carry, acting as
            tangible tokens of support and identity, like stickers, buttons, patches, guitar picks, keychains, and bandanas,
            contrasting with larger items like t-shirts or vinyl, and serving as great low-cost entry points for fans and revenue
            streams for bands.</p>
